# 1. Introduction
This study aims to reproduce the results of **Hense & Beckmann (2006)**, which presented a compartment-based model of the cyanobacteria life cycle. We will compare their findings with our Agent-Based Model (IBM) to evaluate the consistency and potential advantages of the individual-based approach.

# 2. Methodology
We use the code from `../ibm_unchanged` as the baseline, as it represents a clean version of the IBM before the specific *Dolichospermum* modifications.

## 2.1 File Structure
The study is contained in the `hense_beckmann_2006/` directory.
- `src/`: Source code (Fortran).
- `parameters.nml`: Model configuration.
- `scripts/`: Analysis scripts.

# 3. Parameter Extraction
The following parameters are derived from Hense & Beckmann (2006).

| Parameter | Symbol | Value | Unit | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Max Growth Rate | $\mu_{max}$ | `0.25` | $d^{-1}$ | Maximum growth rate of vegetative cells (at 30°C). |
| Half-Sat Constant | $k_N$ | `0.3` | mmol N $m^{-3}$ | Nitrogen half-saturation constant. |
| Migration Velocity | $w_{mig}$ | `1.0` | $m d^{-1}$ | Vertical velocity of buoyant cells. |
| Sinking Velocity | $w_{sink}$ | `0.1` | $m d^{-1}$ | Sinking speed of detritus/akinetes. |
| Transfer Rate | $\tau^{-1}$ | `0.2` | $d^{-1}$ | Rate of transfer between life stages ($2.5 \times 10^{-6} s^{-1}$). |
| Mortality Rate | $\gamma$ | `0.04` | $d^{-1}$ | Base mortality rate ($4.5 \times 10^{-7} s^{-1}$). |
| Akinete Mortality | $\gamma_{aki}$ | `0.0004` | $d^{-1}$ | Akinete mortality (1% of base). |
| Akinete Sinking | $w_{aki}$ | `10.0` | $m d^{-1}$ | Akinete sinking speed ($10 \times w_{mig}$?). Wait, Table 2 says $w/w_{mig} = -10$. So $10 m/d$ downwards. |

*Note: Values converted from $s^{-1}$ to $d^{-1}$ where applicable.*

# 4. Experiments
We performed a baseline seasonal simulation to reproduce the life cycle dynamics.

## 4.1 Baseline Simulation
The model was run for 10 years with the extracted parameters. The results show a clear seasonal succession of vegetative cells and akinetes.

### Results
![Hense & Beckmann (2006) Reproduction: Life Cycle Dynamics](scripts/hense_cycle.png)

### Observations
- **Vegetative Cells (Green)**: Bloom in summer when temperature is high ($>15^\circ$C).
- **Akinetes (Blue)**: Form in autumn/winter when temperature drops below the critical threshold ($<15^\circ$C).
- **Succession**: The population successfully transitions between growing and resting stages, maintaining persistence over multiple years.
- **Abundance**: Peak vegetative abundance reaches $\sim 12,000$ agents (super-agents).

# 5. Conclusion
We have successfully adapted the IBM to include the key parameters and life cycle logic from Hense & Beckmann (2006). The model reproduces the fundamental seasonal alternation between vegetative growth and akinete formation. Future work will refine the 4-stage life cycle and include explicit vertical migration.
